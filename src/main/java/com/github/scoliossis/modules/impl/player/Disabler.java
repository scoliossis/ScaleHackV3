/*
For those of you that don't know, there are a new pair of boots in the game called Great Spook Boots.

Hypixel, are you honestly not aware that "Spook" is a racist slur for a black person? You really couldn't call them "Spooky" or "Halloween" or "Pumpkin" or literally anything else?!

Don't believe me? Too lazy to google it? Here's the wiki page for the word. Scroll down to Slang uses.
Slang for someone involved in espionage
CIA members, in slang
MI5 members, in slang
A racial slur for a black person

A+ patch guys. Really impressed with how little you pay attention to what you put into the game.
